# PkReconstructions

#This repository is aimed to achieve bayesian inference P(k) reconstructions from LSS data.

#The .py and the Notebook are currently working versions with different number of nodes and features.

#In SimulatedData, the different simualted data used for HighZ for different feature templates. Also the seed vector and the densities.

#CosmoChord mimic contains the files used for reproducing CosmoChord previous results.

#In cobaya_likelihood_Original_Guada.ipynb the file cobaya_likelihood.ipynb is given in the original version that GCH send to me.

#Monopole&Likelihood_CAMB.ipynb is an example of a working monopole and likelihood in a notebook.
