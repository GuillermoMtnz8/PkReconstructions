# PkReconstructions

#This repository is aimed to achieve bayesian inference P(k) reconstructions from LSS data.

#In Pk_Simulated_Data_HighZ_NoFeature.dat the monopole galaxy power spectrum simulated data for HighZ objects without any feature in the PPS is given at an array of k, all in units involving h.

#In Densities_HighZ.dat the simulated densities for the HighZ objects are given.

#In Monopole&Likelihood_CAMB the monopole power spectrum and the likelihood to be used are defined.

#In Monopole&Likelihood_CAMB_compact the notebook 'Calculo_Multipolo_CAMB' in compacted in less cells.

#In cobaya_likelihood the settings for running cobaya with our model and likelihood are specified, including a modfication in the matter power spectrum to accomodate the nodes in the primordial power spectrum.
