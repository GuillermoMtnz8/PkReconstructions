# PkReconstructions #

This repository is aimed to achieve bayesian inference P(k) reconstructions from LSS Galaxy Clustering data.

The Notebook '**cobaya_likelihood_4Nodes**' is a currently working script for an example of high-z (1.7) power law simulated data for 4 knots.
This Notebook needs to read the data stored in the folder '**SimulatedData**'.

In the folder '**AltamiraExampleScripts**' some example of scripts ready to be run in Altamira are given, for different knot and feature configurations.
It needs the data stored in the folder '**SimulatedData**'.

The folder '**SimulatedData**' includes the different simualted data used for HighZ and for different feature templates. Also the seed vector and the densities.

'**CosmoChord mimic**' contains the files used for reproducing CosmoChord previous results, including the employed data '**CosmoChord data**'.

In '**cobaya_likelihood_Original_Guada.ipynb**' the file cobaya_likelihood.ipynb is given in the original version that GCH send to me.

'**Monopole&Likelihood_CAMB.ipynb**' is an example of a working monopole and likelihood in a notebook.

Also in this repository we include an aplication to a J-PAS Forecast, in the folder **J-PAS_Forecast**
