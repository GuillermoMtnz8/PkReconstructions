# PkReconstructions

#This repository is aimed to achieve bayesian inference P(k) reconstructions from LSS data.

#In Calculo_Multipolo_CAMB the monopole power spectrum and the likelihood to be used are defined.

#In Calculo_Multipolo_CAMB_compacto the notebook 'Calculo_Multipolo_CAMB' in compacted in less cells.

#In cobaya_likelihood the settings for running cobaya with our model and likelihood are specified, including a modfication in the matter power spectrum to accomodate the nodes in the primordial power spectrum.
